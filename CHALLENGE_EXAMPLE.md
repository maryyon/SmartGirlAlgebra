## 🎬 THE EXPERIENCE (Step-by-Step)

### 1️⃣ **OPENING SCENARIO** (Creates Urgency & Context)

```
⚖️ BALANCE THE STUNT!

OMG bestie—practice is about to start and Coach just blew the whistle 📣

Your stunt group is lifting a flyer, but something is off.

The bases are holding TWO equal strength bands, and the flyer needs 
10 total sparkle-power points to stay balanced in the air ✨

Right now, one band has 3 sparkle-points showing, but the other band 
is hidden inside a glitter box 🎀

We don't know how strong it is… yet.

Your mission: move, balance, and adjust the cheer gear step-by-step 
until BOTH sides of the stunt are totally fair and balanced.

No guessing. No rushing.

Every move you make is a cheer move—and every cheer move is secretly 
algebra 👀

Ready? Hit the mat!
```

**What the user sees**:
- Animated cheerleader flyer wobbling
- Two bases holding bands
- One band shows "3 sparkle-points" ✨
- Other band is in a glitter box with "?" 🎀
- Target meter showing "10 total needed"

---

### 2️⃣ **STEP 1: Observe the Target**

**Instruction**: "Look at the total sparkle-power needed on the right side"

**Hint**: "The flyer needs 10 total points to stay up"

**CheerVoice**: "Okay bestie, check out that number on the right! That's our TARGET ✨"

**Visual**:
- Right side of screen highlights
- Number "10" glows and pulses
- Arrow points to target meter

**User Action**: Click "Got it!" to proceed

---

### 3️⃣ **STEP 2: See What You Have**

**Instruction**: "See what you already have on the left side"

**Hint**: "You can see 3 sparkle-points already"

**CheerVoice**: "Now look at what we've GOT! One band is showing 3 points 💪"

**Visual**:
- Left side highlights
- Band with "3" sparkles and shines
- Counter shows "3 out of 10"

**User Action**: Click "I see it!" to proceed

---

### 4️⃣ **STEP 3: Figure Out What's Missing**

**Instruction**: "Figure out what's missing to make both sides equal"

**Hint**: "What do you add to 3 to get 10?"

**CheerVoice**: "So what's hiding in that glitter box? What number makes this BALANCE? 🤔"

**Visual**:
- Glitter box shakes and sparkles
- Equation appears: "3 + ? = 10"
- User sees the algebra connection!

**User Action**: Think about the answer (no input yet)

---

### 5️⃣ **STEP 4: Interactive Solving**

**Instruction**: "Adjust the hidden band's strength until the stunt balances!"

**Hint**: "Try different values until 3 + your guess = 10"

**CheerVoice**: "Slide that strength meter and watch the magic happen! When it balances, you WIN! 🎉"

**Visual**:
- Slider appears (range 0-15)
- As user slides:
  - Glitter box opens showing current value
  - Left side total updates (3 + slider value)
  - Flyer wobbles more or less based on balance
  - When 3 + 7 = 10, flyer stabilizes!
  - Balance scale tips left/right based on values

**User Action**: 
- Slide to different values
- Watch flyer react
- Find the perfect balance (7)
- Click "Lock it in!" when balanced

---

### 6️⃣ **SUCCESS! (When User Finds 7)**

**Visual Celebration**:
- 🎉 Confetti explosion!
- Flyer does a perfect pose
- Crowd cheering sound effect
- Pompoms fly across screen
- Balance scale perfectly level

**Success Message**:
```
YASSS QUEEN! 🎉 

The stunt is PERFECT! The flyer is stable and the crowd is going WILD!

You figured out the hidden band had 7 sparkle-points! 

That's ALGEBRA, bestie! 💫

You just solved: 3 + x = 10
And found that x = 7!

You're a MATH CHEERLEADER now! 📣
```

**Rewards**:
- +50 points
- +1 pom-pom
- Progress toward next level
- Unlock next challenge

### 7️⃣ **IF USER STRUGGLES** (Encouragement)

After 3 attempts without success:

**Encouragement Messages** (rotate):
- "You're SO close! Keep adjusting! 💪"
- "Almost there! The flyer is wobbling but you've got this! ✨"
- "Don't give up! Every great cheerleader adjusts until it's PERFECT! 🎀"

**Hint Button Available**:

## 🎯 WHY THIS WORKS

### ✅ Meets All Master Prompt Requirements:

1. **Cheerleading Theme**: Stunt, flyer, bases, sparkle-power, coach
2. **7th-8th Grade Voice**: "OMG bestie", "YASSS QUEEN", dramatic, encouraging
3. **Step-by-Step**: 4 clear steps, each building on the last
4. **Visual & Interactive**: Slider, balance scale, animated flyer
5. **No Guessing**: User manipulates and sees results in real-time
6. **Algebra Revealed Gradually**: Story first, then equation appears
7. **Small Actions**: Look, observe, think, adjust, lock in
8. **Urgency**: "Practice is about to start!", "Coach blew the whistle!"
9. **Success = Understanding**: Explains the algebra after solving

### 🎮 Game-First, Math-Second:

- Feels like balancing a stunt (game mechanic)
- Happens to teach solving x + 3 = 10 (math learning)
- User doesn't realize they're doing algebra until the end!

---

## 🔄 REPLAYABILITY

Each time this challenge type appears:
- Different numbers (x + 5 = 12, x + 2 = 9, etc.)
- Different sparkle-power values
- Different cheerleader animations
- Same core mechanic and learning

**Result**: Mastery through repetition with variety!

---

## 📚 ALGEBRA PROGRESSION

This challenge teaches:
1. **Concept**: Variables represent unknown values
2. **Skill**: Balancing equations (what's on both sides)
3. **Operation**: Subtraction (inverse of addition)
4. **Thinking**: "What do I add to X to get Y?"

**Next Challenges Build On This**:
- Multi-step: (x + 3) + 2 = 12
- With multiplication: 2x + 3 = 11
- With negatives: x - 3 = 7
- Systems: Two stunts at once!

---

## 🎉 SUMMARY
