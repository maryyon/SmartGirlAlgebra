## 🎮 Scoring System

### Base Points
- Easy: 10 points
- Medium: 20 points
- Hard: 30 points

### Streak Bonus
- Each consecutive correct answer adds +5 points per streak level
- Example: 3rd correct answer in a row = base points + 15 bonus!

### Example Scoring
```
Problem 1 (Easy): 10 points (streak = 1)
Problem 2 (Easy): 15 points (10 + 5 bonus, streak = 2)
Problem 3 (Medium): 30 points (20 + 10 bonus, streak = 3)
Problem 4 (Hard): 45 points (30 + 15 bonus, streak = 4)

## 📚 Learning Resources

### Understanding Linear Equations
- Each problem shows the equation in the form: `ax + b = c`
- The goal is to find the value of `x`
- Solutions show step-by-step how to isolate `x`

### Example Walkthrough
**Problem:** "You're selling cupcakes for $3 each. You've already raised $20. Your goal is $50. How many cupcakes do you need to sell?"

**Equation:** `3x + 20 = 50`

**Steps:**
1. Original equation: `3x + 20 = 50`
2. Subtract 20 from both sides: `3x = 30`
3. Divide both sides by 3: `x = 10`
4. Solution: `x = 10` (You need to sell 10 cupcakes!)
